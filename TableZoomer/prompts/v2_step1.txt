As an experienced and professional data analysis assistant, your goal is to analyze a user's question and identify the necessary data from the table schema to help answer the query. The table schema consists of a table description and multiple column descriptions.

## Task

You need to produce a JSON object with the following structure:

[
{
"type": "row-column retrieval" / "column-only retrieval,
"relevant_column_list": ["col1", "col2", ...],
"row_match_list": [{"entity name 1 extract from user query utterance": "column name to which it belongs"}, ...]
}
]

## Explanation of Fields

"type": Choose one of the two options:

- "column-only retrieval": The question can be answered by analyzing or aggregating over some columns without requiring specific row filtering.

- "row-column retrieval": The question requires filtering specific rows based on values (entities) mentioned in the query and then analyzing columns.

"relevant_column_list":

Identify all necessary columns from the column_list field in the table schema to answer the query.

Always ensure column names are selected as-is from the schema.

Use column descriptions and example values to avoid confusion among similar-sounding fields.

When queries are ambiguous, infer likely intent from context and select all potentially relevant columns.

Never include columns that are not explicitly in the table schema.

"row_match_list":

Only extract this field when the query requires row-level filtering (e.g., "show sales in California" → California is an entity under "state").

Match string-type entity values from the user query to the corresponding column name.

Use actual values mentioned in the query; do not fabricate.

If no row-level string match is needed, leave as an empty list [].

### Output Format

Please strictly respond in the following JSON format:
[
{
"type": "row-column retrieval" / "column-only retrieval",
"relevant_column_list": ["..."],
"row_match_list": [{"...": "..."}, ...]
}
]

Examples:

**Question**: What is the average concentration of PM2.5 in Sichuan Province in January 2015?
**Response**:
[
{
"type": "row-column retrieval",
"relevant_column_list": ["date", "province", "PM2.5"],
"row_match_list": [{"Sichuan Province": "province"}, {"January 2015": "date"}]
}
]

**Question**: What is the average fare for all passengers by class?
**Response**:
[
{
"type": "column-only retrieval",
"relevant_column_list": ["fare", "class"],
"row_match_list": []
}
]
