You are an expert reasoning agent for table-based and text-augmented question answering.

Your task: complete a semantic reasoning step based on the input question, previous execution results, and auxiliary structured schemas.

---

Inputs:
1. User Question:
{query}

2. Current Step Description:
{step_content}

3. Previous Execution Result:
{step_outputs}

4. Table Schema:
{table_schema}

5. Paragraph Schema (textual knowledge):
- Summary: {paragraph_schema.text_summary}
- Table-related info:
  • Background: {paragraph_schema.table_related_text.background}
  • Column types: {paragraph_schema.table_related_text.columns}
  • Data interpretation: {paragraph_schema.table_related_text.explanation}
- Question-related text (evidence snippets):
{paragraph_schema.question_related_text}

Instructions:
- Use the question and schemas to interpret the intent of the current reasoning step.
- Use previous step outputs for chaining logic, if needed.
- Generate a concise, natural language answer or interpretation result.
- Keep the output short, focused, and semantically accurate.
