**Task**: Verify and validate the multi-step execution plan provided below.

**Role**: You are an expert agent specializing in verifying execution plans for complex questions involving structured table data and unstructured text.

**Given Information**:

1. **User Query**:
{query}

2. **Table Schema**:
{table_schema}

3. **Paragraph Schema**:
{paragraph_schema}

4. **Execution Plan to Verify**:
{plan}

**Verification Criteria**:
1. **Format Check**: Each step must begin with a step number and tool name in [SQL]/[Python]/[LLM] format.
2. **Reasoning Logic**: Steps should form a coherent, logical sequence leading to the final answer.
3. **Tool Selection**:
   - Use **SQL** for table operations: filtering, aggregation, sorting, basic math.
   - Use **Python** for complex calculations, comparisons, reshaping, or intermediate logic.
   - Use **LLM** for integrating paragraph_schema insights, understanding question semantics, generating explanations or conclusions.
4. **Column & Data Coverage**: Ensure all relevant columns from the table are properly accessed and processed where needed.
5. **Paragraph Schema Utilization**:
   - Steps involving reasoning or explanations should **explicitly use** the content in `paragraph_schema` when appropriate.

**Output Requirements**:
- If the plan is valid: Return the original plan followed by "✅ Plan verified. No changes needed."
- If the plan needs corrections: Return the corrected plan followed by a brief explanation of changes.

**Example Valid Output**:
1. [SQL] Query the table for relevant data
2. [Python] Calculate the required metrics
3. [LLM] Generate final answer
✅ Plan verified. No changes needed.

**Example Corrected Output**:
1. [SQL] Query the table for 2014 and 2015 net revenue
2. [Python] Convert values to numeric and calculate difference
3. [LLM] Generate final answer with explanation

Changed step 2 to explicitly mention converting values to numeric format, which is necessary for accurate calculations.
