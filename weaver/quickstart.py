"""
Basic usage examples for Weaver TableQA system.

This demonstrates the new API with support for:
1. Single question answering
2. Batch processing with JSON objects  
3. Optional context (paragraphs, column descriptions, schema)

Setup Instructions:
==================

1. Set your API key as an environment variable:

import os

# For OpenAI
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key"

# For Anthropic Claude  
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "your-anthropic-api-key"

# For Google Gemini
os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"] = "your-gemini-api-key"

# Or set in your shell:
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

2. Configure your model in LiteLLM format:
   - Use "openai/gpt-4o" or provider="openai", model="gpt-4o"
   - Use "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229" for Claude
   - Use "gemini/gemini-pro" for Gemini
   - See LiteLLM docs for all supported providers
