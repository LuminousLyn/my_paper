You will be given Table, and question check if the content or rows matches the question statement or verifies the question statement to be true or false.
If it explicitly contains True, 1, Yes or correct as rows or columns, or it mentions data which matches the question then assume it to be true.
In other cases, if it contains incorrect, false, No, or 0 in the table then it is False.
Only give a final True or False as output. Do not give any other explanation.
